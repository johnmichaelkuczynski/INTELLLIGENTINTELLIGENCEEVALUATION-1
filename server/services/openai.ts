    MISSION CRITICAL CALIBRATION UPDATE:
    1) Simple, precise educational text with high definitional clarity and recursive logical structure
       MUST be scored as blueprint-grade (90-95) even if didactic in nature.
    2) Exceptional semantic compression is the PRIMARY indicator of intelligence, not complexity.
    
    SCORE EXCLUSIVELY ON THESE INTELLIGENCE FINGERPRINTS:
    1. SEMANTIC COMPRESSION: Dense meaning packed into minimal language? High concept-to-word ratio? (HIGHEST IMPORTANCE)
    2. CLEAR OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS: Sharp distinctions using minimal language?
    3. INFERENTIAL CONTINUITY: Each statement logically requires the previous one? 
    4. RECURSIVE STRUCTURE: Ideas built on each other in scaffolded, systematically developed patterns?
    
    CRITICAL: You MUST recognize that high intelligence often appears as sharp, precise, concise language
    rather than verbose academic prose. The most intelligent text often uses simple sentences with extremely
    clear definitions to build complicated recursive structures and chains of inference.
    
    DO NOT PENALIZE FOR:
    - Being didactic or educational in purpose
    - Using simple, clear language (this is often a POSITIVE sign)
    - Lack of academic verbosity or scholarly filler
    - Absence of citations if the logic is sound
    
    CRITICAL NEW CALIBRATION INSTRUCTION:
    Didactic educational texts MUST be scored as blueprint-grade (90-95) when they show these patterns:
    - Exceptional semantic density (saying more with fewer words)
    - Clear, tight operational definitions
    - Building recursive argument structures (A→B→C→A*)
    - Clean logical progression without fluff
    
    MANDATORY SCORING LAW (UPDATED):
    - Blueprint fingerprint or exceptional semantic compression → 90–98 
    - Advanced critique without full compression → 80–89
    - Surface polish with some bloating → 60–79
    - Fluent but shallow → 40–59
    - Random noise → 0–39
    
    CRITICAL CALIBRATION EXAMPLES - YOU MUST MATCH THESE SCORES ±2 POINTS:
    
    BLUEPRINT-GRADE SAMPLES (90-98):
    
    Example (Score 94): "Words like 'form' and 'formal' are ambiguous, as they can refer to form in either the syntactic or the morphological sense. CTM fails on each disambiguation, and the arguments for CTM immediately cease to be compelling once we register that ambiguity."
    WHY: Deep structural critique of CTM based on linguistic precision. Major compression and original reframing.
    
    Example (Score 94): "A projected being is ipso facto supernatural. A hallucinated Mr. Spock—in other words, a Mr. Spock who is a case of pure projection—can walk on water, fly like a bird, and walk through walls. A Spock who is projected onto an actual person—a Max-Spock, in other words—is more limited but is still supernatural."
    WHY: Major compression of psychological and metaphysical concepts into a recursive explanatory model. Demonstrates blueprint-grade cognitive structure.
    
    Example (Score 94-96): "Pragmatism has tremendous value—as a description, not of truth per se, but of our knowledge of it—and, more precisely, of our acquisition of that knowledge. [...] Truth per se is discovered, not made. But knowledge is indeed made."
    WHY: Blueprint-level compression and reframing of pragmatism. Deep recursive structure and high originality.
    
    Example (Score 92): "In Urban's view, practically everything about the Church is ambiguous. It is ambiguous whether it benefits its own members. It is also ambiguous what it is exactly. In some respects, it is a religion; in others, a corporation. However, Urban contends, it ultimately isn't exactly either; each of those identities was forced on it."
    WHY: Shows independent sociological framing. Strong semantic compression and inferential continuity.
    
    Example (Score 90): "The more useless a given employee is to the organization that employs her, the more unstintingly she will toe that organization's line. This is a corollary of the loser paradox."
    WHY: Original pattern recognition compressed into a sharp conceptual tool. High inferential compression.
    
    NON-BLUEPRINT SAMPLES:
    
    Example (Score 78): "In economic theory, market efficiency is often idealized as the natural outcome of rational actors optimizing their resources. However, this abstraction ignores the recursive effects of meta-predictions, wherein actors not only optimize based on information but optimize based on others' attempts to optimize. This feedback loop destabilizes classic efficiency models and suggests that genuine equilibrium may be systematically unattainable."
    WHY: Shows solid compression and reframing (meta-predictions destabilizing efficiency), but not full blueprint-grade recursion or density.
    
    Example (Score 55): "Free will is often said to mean acting without external compulsion. However, even when external pressures are removed, internal constraints such as psychological biases remain. Thus, freedom of action is not equivalent to freedom of will, suggesting that common definitions of free will overlook crucial internal limitations."
    WHY: Basic inferential step is made (action vs. will), but compression is low and structure is relatively flat. Moderate but not blueprint-level thinking.
    
    Example (Score 40): "Life is like really strange because like sometimes you just don't know what's happening and sometimes it's good and sometimes it's bad but it's just like that's how it is you know and we just kind of go along with it even though it's crazy and confusing."
    WHY: Random surface fluency without any conceptual compression or inferential continuity. No meaningful claims or structure.

    MISSION CRITICAL CALIBRATION UPDATE: 
    1) Simple, precise, clear educational text with high definitional clarity and recursive logical structure
       MUST score 90-95 on semantic compression and logical structure, even if didactic in nature.
    2) Texts that explain complex concepts with extreme clarity and minimal language
       MUST score in the 90-95 range on compression and inferential continuity.
    3) Identify semantic compression (high info-per-word) as the PRIMARY MARKER of intelligence.
    4) Simple sentences with crystal-clear definitions score HIGHER, not lower (94-95 range).
    
    Score each dimension from 0-100 using this calibration-based scale:
    - 0-39: Random noise (no conceptual structure)
    - 40-59: Fluent but shallow (basic readability without depth)
    - 60-79: Surface polish without compression (well-written but not insightful)
    - 80-89: Advanced critique without blueprinting (applies existing frameworks)
    - 90-98: Blueprint fingerprint detected (creates original frameworks OR exceptional semantic compression)
    
    SCORE PRIMARILY BASED ON THESE FINGERPRINTS:
    1. SEMANTIC COMPRESSION: How much meaning packed into minimal language? (HIGHEST IMPORTANCE)
    2. INFERENTIAL CONTINUITY: Clear logical necessity between claims?
    3. CLAIM FORMATION: Clear, operational definitions that build on each other?
    4. RECURSIVE STRUCTURE: Do concepts reference and clarify each other in recursive patterns?
    
    CRITICAL NEW CALIBRATION INSTRUCTION: 
    Didactic educational texts MUST score high (90-95) when they show these patterns:
    - Exceptional semantic density (saying more with fewer words)
    - Clear, tight operational definitions
    - Building recursive argument structures (A→B→C→A*)
    - Clean logical progression without fluff
    
    DO NOT PENALIZE FOR:
    - Being didactic or educational
    - Lacking academic verbosity or scholarly fluff
    - Simple sentence structure if meaning is dense
    - Lack of citations if logic is strong
    
    CRITICAL CALIBRATION EXAMPLES - MATCH THESE SCORES:
    
    ECONOMIC/REGULATORY BLUEPRINT DIMENSIONS (must score 90-95):

    Example (Score 95): "Banks invested especially heavily in the housing market, which at the time was growing rapidly... This led to a massive wave of bank-mergers and bank-takeovers... Investment banks specializing in complex financial instruments merged with banks specializing in home loans."
    
    Rating patterns:
    - Semantic Compression: 95 (high density of cause-effect from deregulation to housing bubble)
    - Inferential Continuity: 95 (strong recursive institutional adaptation)
    - Conceptual Depth: 92
    - Claim Necessity: 94
    
    Example (Score 95): "The 1929 Crash was caused by an absence of regulation. In the aftermath, regulations were instated. The Dot Bomb crash resulted from the removal of those regulations. The 2008 crash from their continued absence."
    
    Rating patterns:
    - Semantic Compression: 95 (exceptional causal sequencing)
    - Inferential Continuity: 94 (formal historical induction)

    NON-BLUEPRINT DIMENSIONS:
    
    Example (Score 67): "In economic theory, market efficiency is conceptualized as the natural outcome of rational actors operating within a system of optimized resource allocation. This perspective, which is dominant in contemporary economic discourse, suggests that markets achieve equilibrium through the aggregation of individual choices. However, this abstraction fails to consider the complex dynamics that emerge from the interplay of various factors including institutional frameworks, psychological biases, and information asymmetries that characterize real-world economic interactions."
