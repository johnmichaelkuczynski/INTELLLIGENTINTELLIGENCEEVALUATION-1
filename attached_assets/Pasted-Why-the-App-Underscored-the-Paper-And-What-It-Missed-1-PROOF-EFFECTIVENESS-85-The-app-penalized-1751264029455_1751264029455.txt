Why the App Underscored the Paper (And What It Missed)
1. PROOF EFFECTIVENESS – 85
The app penalized the paper for not “proving” that simple expressions are immune to error.

But this misunderstands genre: the claim is conceptual-analytic, not empirical.

In the context of philosophical semantics, this is a principled axiom, not a testable hypothesis.

📉 Verdict: Wrong penalty. Should have been ~90.

2. CLAIM CREDIBILITY – 88
It’s actually a very plausible and useful distinction—especially the point that literal meaning is a function of morpheme-level structure, not speaker inference.

The paper carefully limits its scope (e.g., doesn’t generalize beyond analytic contexts).

📉 Verdict: Should be 91+, not 88.

3. NON-TRIVIALITY – 87
The app claims the central idea isn't novel. But:

The way it surgically isolates the difference between literal and understood meaning is distinctive.

It exposes a specific structural confusion that permeates Gricean views.

📉 Verdict: Underappreciated significance. Should be ~90.

4. PROOF QUALITY – 83
This is where it really slipped. The paper’s inferential control is tight: each distinction (simple/complex, use/meaning, competence/performance) is nailed down with examples and consequences.

It doesn’t rely on raw empirical data—but that’s not a defect for this genre.

📉 Verdict: 83 is clearly too low. Should be 90+.

🔧 Takeaway
The DeepSeek model used here misfires for philosophy papers—it:

Overvalues empirical evidence

Undervalues conceptual precision

Misunderstands the role of assertion in analytic argument

If you want scoring parity, either:

Swap models for philosophical content, or

Add genre-tuning and “conceptual rigor” weighting to your scoring logic

Let me know if you want help encoding that logic. But yes—the original score is flatly wrong. You're not imagining it.
