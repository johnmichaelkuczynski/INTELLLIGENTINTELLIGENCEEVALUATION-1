BOX A: Literature can be understood as humanityâ€™s attempt to capture experience in language, transforming the fleeting particulars of life into enduring patterns of meaning. It is not limited to storytelling or poetry but encompasses the full spectrum of written expression where form and content interlock to create resonance beyond mere communication. At its best, literature presses language beyond its utilitarian role, forcing words to carry more weight than they seem able to bear, opening up new textures of thought and feeling. It both reflects and shapes culture, preserving collective memory while also challenging prevailing assumptions. To engage with literature is to enter into an ongoing dialogue across time, where imagination, style, and structure become instruments of discovery. BOX B: For an explanation to be good isn't for it to be correct. Sometimes the right explanations are bad ones. A story will make this clear. I'm on a bus. The bus driver is smiling. A mystery! 'What on Earth does he have to smile about?' I ask myself. His job is so boring, and his life must therefore be such a horror.' But then I remember that, just a minute ago, a disembarking passenger gave him fifty $100 bills as a tip. So I have my explanation: 'he just came into a lot of money.' But here is the very different explanation tendered by my seatmate Gus, who, in addition to being unintelligent, is also completely insane. 'The bus-driver is a CIA assassin. This morning he killed somebody who, by coincidence, had the name Benjamin Franklin. Benjamin Franklin (the statesman, not the murder victim) is on the $100 bill. So when the bus driver saw those bills, he immediately thought of that morning's murder. The murder was a particularly enjoyable one; the bus driver is remembering the fun he had, and that's why he's smiling.' BOX C (100 % AI) Let me tell you something about literature, and I'll do it through an example that'll make things clear. Picture yourself reading a book - any book really. What's happening there? Well, it's humans trying to grab hold of life itself using nothing but words. Sounds impossible, right? But here's the thing: literature isn't just about throwing some stories or poems onto paper. No, no - that's like saying cooking is just about not starving.

I was thinking about this the other day while reading an old novel. The author was doing this incredible thing, taking ordinary words - the same ones we use to ask for coffee or give directions - and making them do gymnastics I didn't think words could do. Kind of like my friend Tony, who once tried to fit an entire thanksgiving dinner into a regular-sized lunchbox. Crazy, but he managed it!

Here's what I'm getting at: literature is this massive conversation that's been going on forever, where writers keep finding new ways to twist language until it spills out meanings it wasn't supposed to hold. It's preserving our memories, sure, but it's also poking holes in everything we think we know. And the really wild part? When you pick up a book, you're jumping right into this endless chat that's been happening since humans first figured out how to write things down.

So next time someone asks you what literature is really about, tell them it's like having a time machine made of words. Because that's exactly what it is - even if that sounds completely bonkers at first.
