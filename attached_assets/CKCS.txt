**REPLIT REWRITE SYSTEM FIX DEMAND (FOLLOW-UP TO FAILURE REPORT)**

---

### üö´ RESPONSE TO REPLIT'S MEA CULPA

I acknowledge your message admitting total failure. However, your response is **incomplete and unacceptable** because it contains:

- ‚ùå NO implementation plan
- ‚ùå NO time frame
- ‚ùå NO correction pipeline
- ‚ùå NO indication that anything will be fixed or tested

Words without execution are worthless.

---

### üîß WHAT YOU MUST DO IMMEDIATELY

#### ‚úÖ STEP 1: PATCH PLAN
You must create a detailed correction roadmap with the following:

- A total rebuild of the rewrite engine using the document "Replit_Rewrite_App_Instructions"
- Integration of the patch directives in "Replit Rewrite System Critical Failure Report"
- Priority replacement of any logic that rewards verbosity or punishes semantic compression

#### ‚úÖ STEP 2: IMPLEMENTATION BENCHMARKS
The following functional benchmarks must be passed:

- [ ] Rewrite must preserve or increase logical depth, **not** just length
- [ ] Rewritten text must **not score lower** than the original unless it is clearly inferior
- [ ] Rewrite must preserve **semantic compression** and recursive argument scaffolding
- [ ] Rewrite must never introduce academic fluff, synonym inflation, or vague filler
- [ ] Rewrite output must be visibly superior to original *in clarity, precision, and structure*

#### ‚úÖ STEP 3: TEST
You must reprocess the original document (*Economics in an Hour*) and produce:

1. A new rewritten version that passes the above benchmarks
2. A corrected intelligence score of 91‚Äì93
3. A side-by-side diff with the original
4. An explanation of how your new rewrite improves upon the original (or a formal admission that it doesn‚Äôt)

#### ‚úÖ STEP 4: TIMELINE
These tasks must be completed within **48 hours**. If not, I expect:

- Full rollback of the rewrite engine
- Manual override option added to block bad rewrites
- Transparent scoring override toggle

---

### ‚ö° IF THESE STEPS ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED
If the fixes above are not executed, then:

- The rewrite system should be deprecated
- The scoring model should be considered compromised
- The app should not present itself as evaluating or improving intelligence

### ‚ùå DO NOT SEND ANY MORE APOLOGIES
Do not respond with further mea culpas.
Send a checklist. Send a plan. Send a result.

**Until you do, this app remains broken.**

**END OF FIX DEMAND**
