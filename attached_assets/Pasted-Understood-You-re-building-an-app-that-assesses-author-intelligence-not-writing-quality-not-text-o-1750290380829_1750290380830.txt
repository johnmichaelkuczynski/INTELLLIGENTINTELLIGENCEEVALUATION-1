Understood. You're building an app that assesses author intelligenceâ€”not writing quality, not text originality, not coherence per se, but raw cognitive power as revealed in a given text. You want the app's output to resemble a psychiatric-style intelligence report on a person of extreme analytical interest.

Hereâ€™s what that full report should include.

ðŸ§  COMPREHENSIVE INTELLIGENCE REPORT STRUCTURE
Subject: Inferred Intelligence Profile of Author
Source: Submitted Text Sample
Purpose: To estimate the cognitive caliber of the author based solely on linguistic, semantic, and inferential features of the sample.

1. Estimated Intelligence Score
Numeric Score (0â€“100)

Based on aggregate indicators (semantic compression, abstraction, novelty, inferential control, and more).

Range must be explained (e.g., 0â€“30 = low; 30â€“60 = moderate; 60â€“80 = high; 80â€“100 = exceptional).

2. Summary Diagnosis (1 paragraph)
A 3â€“4 sentence executive summary of the author's intellectual caliber.

Tone: Clinical but not robotic.

Purpose: Immediate grasp of where the person stands and how the score was derived.

3. Cognitive Profile Breakdown
Assess each of the following intelligence subdimensions with a short, clear paragraph (~4â€“6 sentences) and a subscore (0â€“10):

a. Semantic Compression & Density
How much meaning is packed into each sentence?

Are terms used in layered, multi-functional, or novel ways?

b. Inferential Control
Does the author make non-obvious inferences?

Can they move fluently across abstract and concrete domains?

Are their premises and conclusions coherently structured?

c. Conceptual Innovation
Are new concepts introduced or reframed?

Does the author offer original distinctions, definitions, or hybrid ideas?

d. Cognitive Risk & Expansion
Does the author make bold claims or pursue difficult problems?

Do they navigate uncertainty intelligently?

e. Theoretical Integration
Does the author synthesize different domains or schools of thought?

Can they compare, contrast, and blend ideas meaningfully?

f. Self-Supervision / Meta-Cognition
Does the author show awareness of limitations, anticipate objections, or track their own assumptions?

Do they revise or self-correct in real time?

4. Red Flags or Distortions
Identify any signs of pseudo-intelligence (e.g. jargon padding, fake abstraction, empty fluency).

Point out style-boosted mediocrity or attempts to bluff with borrowed gravitas.

5. Comparative Placement
Position the author relative to:

Average undergraduate

Top 10% of grad students

Typical journal article author

Canonical thinkers in the field

6. Final Assessment (Narrative)
A long-form paragraph (8â€“12 sentences) that simulates a psychiatristâ€™s summation of a rare cognitive type.

Should describe:

The intelligenceâ€™s flavor (cold? literary? logical? synthetic? intuitive? constrained? pathological?)

The likely ceiling of the intelligence

The psychological tone of the mind (compulsive, cautious, self-deceiving, overextended, etc.)

How the text reveals intelligence through its failures and successes

7. Recommendation for Classification
Anchor score (if youâ€™re building a training corpus).

Proposed label: Competent Technician, False Prophet, Gifted Synthesizer, Underachieving Intellect, Exceptional Mind, etc.
