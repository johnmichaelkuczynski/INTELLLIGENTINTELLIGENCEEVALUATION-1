ANCHOR TEXT (Score = 75/100):

Most ancient philosophers accept that dreams have prophetic powers enabling humans to relate somehow to a world beyond their own. The only philosophers known to make a clean and explicit break with that tradition are the Epicureans, beginning with Epicurus himself and reaching his last eminent follower, Diogenes of Oinoanda. They openly reject the idea that dreams mediate between the divine and the human realms, or between the world of the living and the world of the dead. They demystify the phenomenon of dreaming by explaining sleeping and dreaming in terms of their materialistic physical theory. Importantly, they examine dreams and their content from different perspectives and explore their relevance to our lives. The general aim of this paper is to offer a synthetic account of the Epicurean view about dreaming and dreams, advance certain new hypotheses that seem worthy of consideration, and show how Epicurus and his followers integrate dream theory into their philosophy as a whole.

This passage demonstrates:

Historical knowledge and scholarly competence

An ability to synthesize information clearly

Structural coherence and stylistic polish

However, it lacks:

Deep abstraction or inferential architecture

Risk-taking or novel conceptual reframing

Compression of insight or multi-level reasoning

The author appears to be well-educated and fluent, but shows limited signs of deep or original philosophical intelligence.

Use this passage to anchor the 75-point range. Texts that reflect similar levels of broad competence without conceptual risk or depth should fall between 70â€“80.

Final output: Return a score (0â€“100) and a paragraph assessing author intelligence only.
Do not evaluate writing quality or style in isolation from underlying cognitive traits.
