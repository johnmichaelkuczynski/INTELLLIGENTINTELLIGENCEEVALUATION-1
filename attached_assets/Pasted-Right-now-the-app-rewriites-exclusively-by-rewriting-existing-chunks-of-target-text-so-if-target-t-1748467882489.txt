Right now, the app rewriites exclusively by rewriting existing chunks of target text. so if target text is 10 chunks and the user does a a rewrite, the rewite is solely a rewrite of those ten chunks. that is fine for some purposes but not for all. sometimes the user will want to rewrite both by rewriting existing chunks and by adding new chunks; or he may just want to add new chunks and not change existing text. do you understand? so i want there to be an option for the user to add existing material, i.e. to get teh app to write new material by adding chunks. so suppose the document is a 10 chunk work on epistemology, and the user wants to keep those 10 chunks the same, but he also wants to add two chunks on knowledge of the past; well, good news, he can do that by using this new feature. do you understand? THE USER HAS TO HAVE THREE CLEAR OPTIONS: REWRITING EXISTING CHUNKS, ADD NEW CHUNKS (WHICH OUTPUTS EXISTING CHUNKS—NTO REWRITTEN—PLUS NEW CHUNKS), AND BOTH ADD NEW CHUNKS AND REWRITE EXISTING CHUNKS. THE COMPLETED REWRITE IS IMMEDIATELY MADE VISIBLE TO HIM IN A POPUP; THE POPUP DOES NOT GO AWAY UNTIL THE USER X’S OUT OF IT. IN THE POPUP, THE USER CAN DOWLOAD AS PDF (VIA PRINT/SAVETOPDF FUNCTION, SO THAT MATH NOTATION IS PRESERVED), DOWNLOAD AS WORD, AND ALSO SHARE (VIA EMAIL/SENDGRID). THE REWRITE MUST REMAIN VISIBLE AND SAV EABLE AND SHAREABLE UNTIL THE USER CLICKS OUT OF IT. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? THERE HAS TO BE A NICE BIG TEXT BOX WHERE THE USER CAN GIVE LENGTHY AND DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS AS TO WHAT WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE EXTRA CHUNKS. DO YOU NDERSATND?

ADD A REWRITE THE REWRITE FEATURE; IN SAME POPUP WHERE REWRITE IS DISPLAYED. USER CAN RIGHT THEN AND THERE REWRITE THE REWRITE; HE CAN PUT IN CUSTOMIZED INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE REWRITE; AND HE CAN DOWLOAD AS PDF (VIA PRINT/SAVEASPDF FUNCTION SO THAT MATH NOTATION IS PRESERVED), DOWNLOAD AS WORD, AND SHARE (VIA EMAIL SENDGRID). DO YOU UNDERSTAND? ALSO, IF THE REWRITE IS LONG (MORE THAN ONE CHUNK) HE CAN CHOOSE WHICH CHUNKS TO RE-REWRITE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
