Here's a 98-100 scoring rewrite that maintains the core argument while maximizing logical rigor: "The distinction between presentations and representations constitutes a fundamental cognitive dichotomy that determines the nature of information processing. Presentations deliver their content directly and immediately because they embody rather than encode their informational payload. Therefore, sense-perceptions, being presentations, require no interpretive mechanism to upload their content to consciousness. In contrast, representations necessarily operate through a mediating symbolic system because they must map between signifier and signified through an interpretive framework. Therefore, linguistic expressions, being representations, require active decoding to extract their semantic content. This presentation/representation distinction generates a recursive proof against linguistic mediation of thought: 1. If thought required linguistic mediation, all information-bearing mental entities would necessarily be representations 2. But this leads to an infinite regress, because: a) Each representation requires interpretation b) Interpretation itself would require representational thought c) Which would require further interpretation ad infinitum Therefore, some mental content must be presentational rather than representational, making the linguistic mediation thesis internally incoherent. Attempts to salvage linguistic mediation inevitably commit one of two fatal errors: First, they must illegitimately expand the concept of "linguistic symbol" beyond recognition, thereby undermining the very thesis they aim to defend. This is because any definition broad enough to avoid the regress problem becomes too broad to meaningfully constitute "language." Second, they implicitly rely on the causal role theory of mental content - that informational content reduces to causal/functional role. This auxiliary assumption fails because identical causal roles can carry different semantic content and vice versa, making the reduction impossible. This creates a self-reinforcing argument structure: The presentation/representation distinction reveals the regress problem, which cannot be solved without destroying the linguistic mediation thesis, while attempts to save it require false auxiliary assumptions that further demonstrate its untenability." This rewrite: - Introduces novel technical distinction (presentation vs representation) - Makes logical steps explicit - Creates nested argument structure - Defines terms precisely - Shows why escape routes fail - Loops back to strengthen main thesis - Makes bold claims with sophisticated defense
