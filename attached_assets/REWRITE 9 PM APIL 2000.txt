**REPLIT REWRITE ENGINE FAILURE REPORT: ECONOMICS IN AN HOUR**

---

### üìà SUBJECT OF EVALUATION

**Original Document**: *Economics in an Hour* (uploaded separately)
**Rewritten Output**: *rewritten-text-2025-05-01.docx* (uploaded separately)
**App Intelligence Score Given**: 70/100

---

### ‚ùå CORE VERDICT: TOTAL FAILURE

The app has catastrophically misjudged the intelligence of the source material and produced a rewritten version that is *significantly* inferior in clarity, density, conceptual structure, and tone.

---

### üîü WHAT WENT WRONG

#### 1. ‚ùå **Bad Rewrite Quality**
- The original is clean, recursive, logically structured.
- The rewrite bloats every paragraph with fluff and academic filler.
- The rewrite turns tight distinctions into vague textbook waffle.
- No improvement in argument. No added depth. Only verbal garbage.

#### 2. ‚ùå **Broken Scoring Logic**
- The original deserved a 91‚Äì93/100 for semantic compression, conceptual clarity, and logical recursion.
- The app penalized it for being clean and didactic.
- It rewarded the rewritten version for verbosity and fake polish.

### ‚ö° EXAMPLES

#### Original:
> "Currency is money. Money is a certificate of wealth that is not itself of any value."

#### Rewrite:
> "Currency functions as money, a representation of wealth with no intrinsic value... thanks to social conventions."

ü§¶\200d‚ôÇÔ∏è Verdict: Style inflation, no gain in depth. Original was sharper.

### ‚ùÑ REAL INTELLIGENCE PROFILE OF ORIGINAL

| Category | Rating | Reason |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Semantic Compression | ‚úÖ Very Strong | High info-per-word density |
| Claim Formation | ‚úÖ Strong | Clear, operational definitions |
| Inferential Continuity | ‚úÖ Very Strong | Builds recursive economic logic |
| Definition Coherence | ‚úÖ Strong | Consistent usage and scaffolding |

**True Score: 91‚Äì93/100**

### üîß HOW TO FIX THIS APP

#### 1. ‚úÖ **Rewrite Evaluation Logic**
- Stop penalizing tight, didactic exposition.
- Stop rewarding verbosity with no inferential content.
- Detect recursive argument structures (A‚ÜíB‚ÜíC‚ÜíA*)
- Recognize distinction-making and operational definitions as marks of intelligence.

#### 2. ‚úÖ **Rewrite Engine Correction**
- Do NOT inflate for tone.
- Do NOT add scholarly fluff.
- Rewrite sentence-by-sentence to **improve logic**, not to sound fancier.
- Preserve authorial compression, clarity, and argument transitions.

#### 3. ‚úÖ **Evaluation Correction**
- Add sanity check: If original text is structurally clearer and more precise than rewrite, flag rewrite as failed.
- Add override: If intelligence score drops after rewrite, suppress output and request human check.

### ‚ùó CONCLUSION

This rewrite engine failed. The rewrite was shit. The intelligence score was wrong by at least 20 points. The evaluation logic is broken, and the rewrite logic is worse.

**Fix it. Now.**
