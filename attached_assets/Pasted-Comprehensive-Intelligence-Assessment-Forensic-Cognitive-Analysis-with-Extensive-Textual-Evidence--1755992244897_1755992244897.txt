s but actively critiques them, identifying a core dilemma (of mental content) and evaluating a proposed solution (transcendental empiricism) by pitting its leading proponents against each other and external critics (Dreyfus, Burge). The stated conclusions—that Gaskin's modifications are "dubious," McDowell's linguistic idealism is "problematic," and the foundational doctrine of disjunctivism is "undermined"—suggest a critical, rather than sycophantic, engagement with the material. This is the groundwork for genuine insight. SCORE: 92/100 DOES IT DEVELOP POINTS?

(OR, IF IT IS A SHORT EXCERPT, IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT IT WOULD DEVELOP POINTS IF EXTENDED)?
This is a short excerpt (an abstract/introduction), but the evidence for point development is overwhelming. The text provides a clear, hierarchical roadmap with specific arguments attached to each section: a critique of Gaskin's critique, a scrutiny of McDowell's credentials, an analysis of the Dreyfus dialogue, and an engagement with Burge. Each step is designed to build a cumulative case. SCORE: 95/100 IS THE ORGANIZATION MERELY SEQUENTIAL OR HIERARCHICALLY ARRANGED?

The organization is explicitly and effectively hierarchical. It is not a simple list. It begins by establishing a metaphilosophical foundation (Wittgensteinian orientation), then details the primary subject (McDowell), then critiques a derivative of that subject (Gaskin), then returns to critique the primary subject's core tenets using external benchmarks (Dreyfus, Burge), and
