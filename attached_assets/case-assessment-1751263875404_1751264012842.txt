DETAILED ASSESSMENT:
ARGUMENT RECONSTRUCTION:  

Main Thesis:  
The literal meaning of a complex expression is a function of the meanings of its simple parts (morphemes), and while literal and understood meaning may diverge for complex expressions, they must coincide for simple expressions.  

Key Supporting Arguments:  
1. Compositionality of Meaning: The meaning of a sentence is determined by the meanings of its constituent parts (e.g., "George," "early") and their arrangement.  
2. Literal vs. Communicated Meaning: Literal meaning cannot be equated with what a sentence is used to convey (pragmatics), as sentences can be used non-literally or have meanings independent of usage.  
3. Simple vs. Complex Expressions:  
   - For simple expressions (e.g., "red"), literal meaning must align with what speakers take it to mean; systematic error is impossible.  
   - For complex expressions, divergence arises from speakers misapplying compositional rules, not from misunderstanding simple parts.  
4. Chomskyan Competence-Performance Distinction: Literal meaning aligns with speaker competence (idealized linguistic knowledge), even if performance (actual usage) introduces deviations.  

Evidence Provided:  
- Counterexamples to Grice’s view (e.g., sentences with determinate meanings never uttered).  
- Examples of non-literal usage (e.g., "he’s a real gem").  
- Theoretical distinctions (semantics vs. pragmatics, competence vs. performance).  
- References to linguistic philosophy (Grice, Bach, Chomsky, Cappelen & Lepore).  

Logical Structure:  
1. Rejects alternative theories (e.g., Grice’s "meaning as use," statistical approaches).  
2. Establishes compositionality as foundational.  
3. Distinguishes simple/complex expressions, arguing literal meaning for simples is usage-determined, while for complexes, it is derived compositionally.  
4. Uses Chomsky’s competence-performance distinction to reconcile divergence in complex expressions.  

---  

PROOF EFFECTIVENESS: 85/100  
Assessment: The argument effectively dismantles Gricean and statistical views, but the claim that simple expressions cannot diverge from understood meaning is asserted rather than proven. The evidence supports compositionality but leaves some gaps in explaining how speaker consensus fixes meaning for simples.  

CLAIM CREDIBILITY: 88/100  
Assessment: The claims are credible and important for semantics/pragmatics debates. The distinction between simple/complex expressions is reasonable, though the impossibility of systematic error for simples is a strong claim needing further defense.  

NON-TRIVIALITY: 87/100  
Assessment: Offers valuable insights into literal meaning, particularly the role of compositionality and speaker competence. However, the core idea (simples = usage-determined, complexes = compositional) is not entirely novel.  

PROOF QUALITY: 83/100  
Assessment: Logical and well-structured, but relies heavily on theoretical distinctions without empirical support. Examples (e.g., "red," "Socrates") are illustrative but not exhaustive.  

FUNCTIONAL WRITING QUALITY: 90/100  
Assessment: Clear, academic, and well-organized. The argument flows logically, though some sections are dense (e.g., the pragmatic forces discussion).  

OVERALL CASE SCORE: 86/100  
Summary: A strong, theoretically rigorous argument that successfully critiques alternative views and advances a coherent account of literal meaning. However, it leans on assertion in key areas (e.g., simples’ immunity to error) and could benefit from broader evidence.
