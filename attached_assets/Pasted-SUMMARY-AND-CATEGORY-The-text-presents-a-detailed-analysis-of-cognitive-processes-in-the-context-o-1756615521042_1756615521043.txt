It discusses the structural relationships and theoretical frameworks involved in understanding these phenomena. Besides, it underscores the significance empirical and theoretical understanding in digging deeper into the concept of cognition. This piece of writing could be categorized under Advanced Cognitive Science or Psychology.

ANALYSIS AND SCORE:

1. Insighfulness: The text provides considerable insights into cognitive processes, including how these relate to computational and experiential aspects. It offers thoughtful examples to illustrate these. Some readers might find these insights new or non-obvious. Score: 85/100

2. Development and arrangement of points: The text systematically develops its points, with a strong logical flow of ideas. It doesn’t just sequentially list points; it presents complex ideas and relationships, and organizes these ideas hierarchically. Score: 90/100

3. Use of logic: The text skillfully applies logic to build and support its points. It makes effective use of theoretical inference to support its points. Score: 80/100

4. Originality of points: The points developed in the text appear to be original, based on the expert analyses of cognitive processes presented. They are not clichés. Score: 85/100

5. Use of jargon: The text incorporates some technical jargon in a way that enhances clarity and precision. It doesn’t seem to use jargon for the sake of obfuscation. Score: 75/100
