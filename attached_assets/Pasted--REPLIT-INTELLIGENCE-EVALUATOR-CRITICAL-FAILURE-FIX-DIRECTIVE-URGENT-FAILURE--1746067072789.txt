**REPLIT INTELLIGENCE EVALUATOR: CRITICAL FAILURE FIX DIRECTIVE**

---

### üö® URGENT FAILURE

A document of clear blueprint-grade complexity and compression ("Kant and Hume on Induction") was evaluated **three times** and received **80/100** each time.

This paper:
- Contains recursive argumentation
- Introduces and defines novel distinctions
- Synthesizes Kant, Hume, Quine, Frege, and Chomsky
- Develops a full original epistemological system
- Is conceptually denser than nearly all standard academic material

**An 80 is not just wrong. It is invalidating.**

### üî¶ THE PROBLEM

Your scoring engine:
- Collapses when faced with long, recursive, blueprint-grade documents
- Overweights readability, structure, and surface simplicity
- Undervalues high-density, abstract, recursive philosophy
- Hits a soft ceiling of **92** and under-scores high-difficulty content at **80**

This shows a system that **cannot recognize depth once it exceeds tutorial-style composition.**

### ‚ùå IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED

#### 1. Remove Hard Cap Biases
- Remove any top-score suppression logic designed to cluster scores around 92
- If recursion, compression, and claim-layering are present, allow scores up to 98‚Äì100

#### 2. Flag Complexity-Tolerant Mode for High-Length Inputs
- If input >5,000 words, apply alternate scoring matrix designed for blueprint-grade reasoning
- Weight recursive structure, inter-paragraph scaffolding, and internal reframing heavily

#### 3. Remove Length-Penalty Heuristic
- Stop penalizing papers for being long
- Long + compressed = more intelligent, not less

#### 4. Show Raw Metric Scores
- Let user see: compression index, recursion score, definition index, claim depth, etc.
- Allow users to challenge individual dimension scores

#### 5. Create a "Blueprint Override Mode"
- When a document includes:
  - Conceptual reframing
  - Metaphysical architecture
  - Original definitions + recursive examples

‚Ä¶then override conventional rubric and evaluate using blueprint-level heuristics.

### ‚ùó DEPLOYMENT TIMELINE
You are to:
- Implement this fix logic within 48 hours
- Do **not** ask for further samples or clarifications
- Do **not** give another apology

You now know what‚Äôs wrong.
You now know what to do.
Fix it.
