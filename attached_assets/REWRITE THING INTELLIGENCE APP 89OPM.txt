**Replit Rewrite App — Full Instruction Set (Intelligence Mode)**

---

### 🔐 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

Build a rewrite engine that upgrades the *intelligence* of a given input text without dumbing it down, bloating it, or formatting it like machine garbage.

---

### 🔄 REWRITE FUNCTION

#### ✅ Mandatory Behaviors:
- Preserve or slightly increase **length** (100% to 110% of original)
- Preserve or **increase** conceptual **depth** and precision
- Never summarize, simplify, casualize, or inflate
- Never introduce padding, rhetorical filler, or fake "academic" gibberish
- Rewrite **sentence-by-sentence** for sharper logic, not stylistic smoothing
- No markdown or formatting symbols (`###`, `***`, etc.)
- Final output must be **clean**, **editorial-grade**, and **print-ready**

#### ❌ Forbidden Behaviors:
- No verbosity without added information
- No GPT-style bloating or synthetic transitions
- No journalistic tone
- No simplification of concepts or logic chains

### 👨‍🔧 USER CONTROLS

- Input box where the user pastes original text
- Dropdown or freeform text field where user specifies desired rewrite behavior
  - Examples:
    - "Clarify argument without adding length"
    - "Preserve structure but elevate tone"
    - "Make more recursive"
    - "Add precision without verbosity"

---

### 📥 OUTPUT TOOLS

- “**Copy**” button: Copies rewritten output to clipboard
- “**Clear**” button: Clears the rewrite output box
- “**Download**” button:
  - Options: `.pdf` and `.docx`
  - Must format with real headers/paragraphs (no code formatting)

---

### 🔮 EVALUATE REWRITE BUTTON

- One-click button to run the rewrite back through the intelligence evaluator
- Does **not** require user to paste rewritten text into a separate input box

---

### 🔍 AI DETECTION

- “**Detect AI**” button to analyze rewritten output using GPTZero or equivalent API
- Display verdict clearly: "Likely AI-written" / "Likely Human-written" / "Unclear"

---

### 📧 EMAIL FUNCTIONALITY (SENDGRID)

- Allow user to email rewritten output to self or other
- Uses verified SendGrid integration
- Clean email formatting (no markdown artifacts)
- Subject line: "Your Rewritten Text"

---

### ✨ REWRITE QUALITY CRITERIA

1. **Length**: 100% to 110% of input
2. **Depth**: Conceptual density must be maintained or increased
3. **Argument**: No steps dropped; recursive chains preserved
4. **Clarity**: Improved logic, NOT smoothed fluff
5. **Format**: No markdown. Clean, printable paragraphs
6. **Voice**: No tone-softening, unless explicitly requested

---

### 📄 SUMMARY

You are building an **intelligence-focused rewrite engine** with full document utility, flexible control, and high-end formatting/export capability. No summarizing. No smoothing. No markdown artifacts. The app must preserve and sharpen.

Build it like it’s meant for top-tier editors, philosophers, or researchers—because it is.
