A fuller examination of what literature represents will clarify both its nature and its significance. Why does written expression achieve something that ordinary communication cannot? Because, according to the conventional understanding, it transcends the merely utilitarian function of language. But, a skeptic might object, perhaps we should question that understanding; perhaps there exists an alternative view that accounts for the same phenomena just as effectively. But, I would argue, even assuming for the sake of discussion that such an alternative could be formulated, it does not follow that it resolves more difficulties than the view it would displace. It does not follow that it represents an improvement from the perspective of explanatory power—that it eliminates as many problems as the established view while generating no additional complications. In practice, quite the reverse typically occurs. Take the alternative framework suggested above. The burden of that approach—meaning what new contradictions it generates—far exceeds its benefit—meaning what existing contradictions it resolves. It would be challenging to construct a theory at odds with the standard one that, while still accounting for the observable evidence, proves equally effective in terms of explanatory coherence. This can be verified through direct examination. If there exists grounds for believing that even one such theory is viable, it is not because any has actually been demonstrated. Those grounds, if they exist at all, would have to be entirely abstract. And for reasons that will become apparent, no purely abstract justification can warrant adopting such a position. But there exists an additional obstacle for this—or, through comparable reasoning, for any alternative—substitute for the established understanding. It remains far from certain that, when the pertinent complexities are taken into account, the substitute proves even theoretically sound. Considered in isolation, a rival theory might outline circumstances that appear internally consistent. It might avoid outright contradiction in the narrow sense. But that by itself does not suffice for it to function as an adequate framework for the available evidence. Consider the network of foundational assumptions that would need to be abandoned. Abandoning them, if achievable at all, would generate cascading effects. Think of the numerous relationships that would be transformed, the equilibria destabilized, the processes interrupted. Those relationships do not merely support the particular phenomenon under consideration. Eliminating them would produce numerous additional ramifications—developments unconnected to the specific objectives of the proposed framework. And there exists no guarantee that these additional ramifications would prove consistent, even in a strictly logical sense, with the evidence the proposed theory purports to explain as successfully as the established theory it aims to supplant.
