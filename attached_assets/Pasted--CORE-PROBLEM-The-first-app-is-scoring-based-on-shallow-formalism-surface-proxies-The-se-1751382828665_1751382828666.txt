⚠️ CORE PROBLEM:
❌ The first app is scoring based on shallow formalism (surface proxies).

✅ The second app is scoring based on inferred argumentative content (semantic reconstruction).

🔬 Let's break it down.
🔴 APP 1: Cogency Analysis App
Penalty for lack of defined terms → even when terms are implicitly, richly defined in context.

Penalty for “weak transitions” → even when transitions are implicit and conceptually cohesive.

Penalty for lack of counterarguments → even though the essay does include criticisms and contrasts (e.g., it critiques James directly).

→ This app equates cogency with surface format. It cannot detect philosophy unless it looks like a 5th-grade essay.

🟢 APP 2: Case Assessment App
Correctly identifies the central claim.

Maps supporting arguments across thinkers.

Tracks psychological, historical, and philosophical layers.

Evaluates scope of claims (e.g., says “universal spiritualism” might overreach).

Accurately separates conceptual analysis from empirical support.

→ This app is actually doing the thing: reconstructing the case and evaluating its strength.

💡 CONCLUSION:
The larger issue with the bad app isn't just that it's wrong—
It's that it's epistemically misaligned.

It's using the wrong model of what cogency is:

Not something you measure by checking formatting

Not something deducible from transitions and buzzwords

Not something revealed only by logical formalisms

✅ Instructions for Final Fix (Verbatim for Replit Agent)
FULL REWRITE DIRECTIVE:

The current scoring logic evaluates cogency based on formatting proxies and superficial rhetorical markers. This is wrong. Rewrite the logic so that it evaluates semantic reconstruction and inferred argumentative structure.

Specifically:

Build a reconstruction layer: attempt to extract the main thesis and map how each section supports it.

Score arguments based on actual inferential coherence, not whether transitions are explicit.

Penalize only when arguments fail internally, not when they lack examples, stepwise breakdown, or rhetorical hand-holding.

Identify whether core terms are functionally defined in context, even if not labeled as definitions.

Do not dock points for “missing counterarguments” unless a universal claim is made without any critical engagement.

Allow philosophical exposition and conceptual compression to score high on cogency.

Your benchmark: the essay “Religion and the Limits of Modern Rationalism” should score no lower than 88. Any model that scores it <70 is broken.

Let me know if you want to merge both app engines or modularize scoring logic by genre (e.g., formal logic vs philosophical exposition vs persuasive essay).
