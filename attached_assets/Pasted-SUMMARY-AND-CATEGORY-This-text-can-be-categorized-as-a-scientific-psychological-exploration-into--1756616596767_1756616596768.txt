SUMMARY AND CATEGORY: 
This text can be categorized as a scientific/psychological exploration into the fundamental aspects of human cognition. It juxtaposes computational and experiential aspects of cognition and delves into the concepts of cognitive relationships, theoretical frameworks, and understanding of relationships.

IS IT INSIGHTFUL? - It provides a fair amount of insight into the core elements of cognition. The theoretical inferences provide value. (85/100)
DOES IT DEVELOP POINTS? - Yes, the text develops its points considerably, extending from definitions to implications, such as in the analysis of structural cognitive relationships. (90/100)
IS THE ORGANIZATION MERELY SEQUENTIAL? - The text’s organization is primarily sequential but with a degree of logical scaffolding (85/100)
IF THE POINTS IT MAKES ARE NOT INSIGHTFUL, DOES IT OPERATE SKILLFULLY WITH CANONS OF LOGIC/REASONING. - The points made are insightful and the reasoning is mostly clear. (90/100)
ARE THE POINTS CLICHES? - The points made are not cliches but rather delve deeply into the topic. (80/100)
DOES IT USE TECHNICAL JARGON TO OBFUSCATE OR TO RENDER MORE PRECISE? - The jargon used seems to render more precise, rather than to obfuscate. (80/100)
IS IT ORGANIC? – Yes, the points seem to develop organically. (85/100)

IS IT REAL OR IS IT PHONY? – The text appears to be authentic and well-researched. (85/100)
DO THE SENTENCES EXHIBIT COMPLEX AND COHERENT INTERNAL LOGIC? – The sentences within the text exhibit complex and coherent internal logic. (85/100)
IS THE PASSAGE GOVERNED BY A STRONG CONCEPT? - Yes, the concept of cognitive processes and cognitive relationships. (90/100)
ARE THE POINTS 'REAL'? - The points seem to be 'real' and grounded in thorough research. (85/100)
IS THE WRITING EVASIVE OR DIRECT? - The writing is direct and extensively addresses its points. (90/100)
ARE THE STATEMENTS AMBIGUOUS? - Some sentences might be a bit ambiguous due to their complexity but in general, the statement is simple and clear. (80/100)
DOES THE AUTHOR USE OTHER AUTHORS TO DEVELOP HIS IDEAS OR TO CLOAK HIS OWN LACK OF IDEAS? - The text is original and not overly reliant on external sources. (80/100)

CONCLUSION: A comprehensive and thought-provoking exploration of the theoretical and practical aspects of cognition. The piece presents well-developed, substantial points and exhibits a sound internal logic.
