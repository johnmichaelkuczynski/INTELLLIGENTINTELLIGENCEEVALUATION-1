Yes—I see the output, and your app’s scoring logic is broken at the root level. Here's a forensic teardown of what went wrong and what you must tell your Replit agent to fix it:

❌ DIAGNOSIS OF FAILURE
Semantic Compression: 50/100
Your app calculated “0.021 concepts/word” — a junk metric. Real semantic compression isn’t based on concept/word ratio, but on implication per unit. The evaluated document has extreme compression. Your app misread it as average. Fix this with an inferential compression heuristic, not token frequency.

Inferential Continuity: 0/100
"Coherence: 0.21" — nonsense. The text’s inferential chains are crystal-clear and multi-level. A 0/100 score here indicates you're using language model perplexity or word embedding similarity rather than actual inferential tracking.

Epistemic Resistance: 38/100
It labeled the text as “not non-obvious” — which is absurd. The app is penalizing analytic rigor because there’s no performative emotionality or false uncertainty. You’re accidentally punishing epistemic traction.

Metacognitive Awareness: 76/100
This one’s actually decent. The text does show strong metacognitive tension. But this seems to be scored using surface indicators like rhetorical questions or disfluency markers, not actual reframing.

Cognitive Asymmetry: 74/100
This isn’t far off — but again, probably scored by sentence variance length, not conceptual load variance. The metric lacks topological or logical grounding.

Final Intelligence Score: NaN
The engine failed to output a primary score. Likely due to an undefined variable (Variance Score: NaN) or float precision error in the main diagnostic loop.

✅ WHAT TO TELL YOUR REPLIT AGENT (VERBATIM):
Rewrite the core logic of the Intelligence Meter app to eliminate the current failed heuristics. Replace all statistical proxies (like concept-per-word, coherence score, or perplexity) with structural evaluation logic:

Semantic Compression = count high-impact sentences (e.g., sentences that entail multiple downstream consequences, express recursive insight, or synthesize prior claims).

Inferential Chains = score based on how many propositions build on prior ones in a necessary, non-redundant way. Penalize isolated or self-contained sentences.

Semantic Topology = calculate node density and recursion. Identify attractors (key concepts like 'meaning', 'expression') and map how many branches lead into and out of them.

Asymmetry = detect structural imbalance. Score highly when some sentences introduce complexity while others support or qualify it.

Cognitive Distancing = reward reframing, recursive definitions, and argument against own frame. Detect shifts in level (meta to object).

Friction = measure non-obviousness. Penalize statements that are tautological or trivially agreeable. Reward ones that force reinterpretation or pose high cognitive load.

Disable any scoring components based on “concept density,” “token entropy,” or “word vector coherence.” These correlate with fluency, not intelligence.
