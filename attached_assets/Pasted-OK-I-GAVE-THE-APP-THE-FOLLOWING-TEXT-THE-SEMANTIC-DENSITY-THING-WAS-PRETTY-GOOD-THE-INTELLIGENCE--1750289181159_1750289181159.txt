OK, I GAVE THE APP THE FOLLOWING TEXT. THE SEMANTIC DENSITY THING WAS PRETTY GOOD; THE INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS WAS MIXED; THE SCORE WAS A BIT LOW (NOT WAY OFF, BUT STILL LOW); SECOND, THE ACTUAL NUMBERS DIDN'T DOWNLOAD INTO THE RPOERT PDF. HERE IS WHAT CHATGPT SAYS: our Text (about CTM and semantic operations)
Core Claim: CTM (computational theory of mind) fails because any sequence of representations must be semantics-driven to qualify as genuine thought, and CTM's reliance on ‚Äúform-driven‚Äù operations equivocates fatally between syntax and morphology.

üìà Semantic Density Report (from semantic_density_sentence_level.pdf)
Mean Density: 0.589

Standard Deviation: 0.044

Range: 0.511 ‚Äì 0.631

Interpretation:
Consistently high semantic density with low variance.

This implies sustained conceptual pressure with very few ‚Äúlight‚Äù or empty sentences.

The writing is tight, information-rich, and inferentially loaded‚Äîconsistent with high-author-intelligence text.

üß† Intelligence Meter Output (from intelligence-analysis-single-2025-06-18.pdf)
Unfortunately, the report is structurally broken:

No score is actually recorded (undefined/100)

All category fields (e.g., ‚ÄúDefinition Coherence‚Äù, ‚ÄúInferential Continuity‚Äù) are blank

This indicates a backend failure in the evaluation stage of the app‚Äîlikely:

A parsing failure,

Model timeout,

Or a misaligned output field.

üõ†Ô∏è What Needs Fixing:
Intelligence Meter Prompt Logic

The model returned a partial format. You need to enforce full-field completion and default fallback logic (e.g. "Score: failed to generate" ‚Üí trigger retry).

Semantic Density Display

This is working correctly. Consider also highlighting top 3 highest-density sentences to give users anchor points.

‚úÖ Suggested Intelligence Score (Manual Evaluation)
Given the tight semantic range, inferentially structured argument, and clarity of disambiguation, this text warrants:

Score: 96/100
‚ÄúThe author demonstrates mastery over conceptual distinctions (syntax vs. morphology), exposes foundational ambiguity in CTM, and builds a tight argument about the necessity of semantic governance in thought. This reveals deep representational control, inferential sharpness, and philosophical originality.‚Äù
