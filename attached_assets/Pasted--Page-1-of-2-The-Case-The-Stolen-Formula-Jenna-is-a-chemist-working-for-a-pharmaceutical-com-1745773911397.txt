The Case: The Stolen Formula
Jenna is a chemist working for a pharmaceutical company. One day, she receives an
anonymous message:
“Send us the formula for your new cancer drug, or we’ll release fake lab reports
under your name showing you falsified test results in previous studies. You have 24
hours.”
The Threat:
The threat is the release of forged documents that would destroy Jenna’s reputation and career.
The blackmailer claims they have already planted enough evidence to make it look convincing,
and they will go public if she doesn't comply.
The Outcome of Not Giving In:
If Jenna does not send the formula, the fake documents will be sent to her employer, the
media, and the licensing board. She could lose her job, face legal investigations, and have her
professional credibility ruined—possibly forever.
Jenna's Options:
1. Give in to the threat and send the formula, betraying her company and possibly risking
public health if the drug is misused.
2. Refuse to comply and risk her career and reputation being destroyed by a lie.
3. Report the threat to the authorities or her employer and hope the blackmailer can be
stopped or discredited before any damage is done.
Are they morally responsible under coercion?
If the coercive threat is serious—say, threatening the agent's life or the lives of loved ones—it
significantly undermines their ability to act freely. In such cases, the agent may still technically
have a choice, but it's one made under extreme pressure. Many would argue the agent is less
morally responsible or perhaps not responsible at all because their action was not entirely
voluntary. The greater the coercion, the less we tend to hold someone morally accountable.
Are they blameworthy or praiseworthy under coercion?
In most cases, if an agent acts wrongly under coercion, we may say they are not fully
blameworthy. For instance, if someone commits a crime because their family was threatened,
we might still view the action as wrong but excuse it to a degree due to the extreme
circumstances.
However, if they perform a morally good action under coercion (donating money because they
were blackmailed), we also don’t typically consider them praiseworthy, because the action was
not motivated by good will or moral conviction.
What if they performed the same action without the coercive threat?
Now, if the agent performed the same action without any coercion:
● If the action is morally bad, and they did it of their own free will, then they are clearly
morally responsible and blameworthy. They chose to do wrong when they could have
done otherwise.
● If the action is morally good, and they did it voluntarily, they are morally responsible and
praiseworthy, because their action reflects good character or moral motivation.
Conclusion
Coercion complicates moral responsibility. While agents under coercion may still technically act,
the moral weight of their actions is lessened because they are not acting with full freedom.
Without coercion, moral responsibility is clearer, and we can more confidently assign blame or
praise based on the agent's motivations and choices.
