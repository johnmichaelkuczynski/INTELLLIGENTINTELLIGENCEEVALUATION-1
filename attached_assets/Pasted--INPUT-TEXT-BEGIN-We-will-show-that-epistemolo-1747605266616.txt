We will show that epistemology can be ‘naturalized’, meaning that it can be profitably studied by studying actual cases of knowledge-acquisition, as opposed to merely engaging in armchair conceptual analysis...

Evidence-Based Justification:
- "We will show that epistemology can be ‘naturalized’..." — This sets up a bold and clearly defined thesis, indicating high conceptual control.
- "Given only that an intelligent system solves a given problem..." — Demonstrates inferential reasoning grounded in analogical structure.
- "Reverse-engineering the brain..." — Introduces a methodology that reflects originality and philosophical ambition.
- "We understand computers because we program them..." — A concise, high-compression sentence connecting epistemology with software logic.
- "Formal logic of its very nature is idle until all of these bridges have been crossed..." — Strong semantic load and thematic insight, albeit slightly metaphorical.

Summary Assessment:
This text demonstrates a high level of intelligence and deep inferential structure. The author's claim that epistemology can be naturalized via AI and reverse engineering is both original and well-supported. The writing reflects strong command over abstract reasoning and makes use of analogical structures to bridge disciplines. The section on formal logic is particularly strong in semantic compression, identifying a core limitation in the use of logical rules as explanatory engines. Minor issues include occasional jargon density and slightly overextended metaphors, but these do not detract meaningfully from clarity. Overall, this is a sophisticated philosophical argument that justifies its claims through layered logic and interdisciplinary synthesis.
