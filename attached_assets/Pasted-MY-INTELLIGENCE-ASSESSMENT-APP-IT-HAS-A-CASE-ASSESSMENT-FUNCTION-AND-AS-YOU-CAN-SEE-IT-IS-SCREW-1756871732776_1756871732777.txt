MY INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENT APP: IT HAS A 'CASE ASSESSMENT' FUNCTION; AND AS YOU CAN SEE, IT IS SCREWED UP; NO REAL SCORES; AND JUST ONE GIANT PARAGRAPH. I HAVE TOLD REPLIT ABOUT THIS SEVERAL TIMES BUT IT HAS NO IDEA WHAT TO DO. I see exactly what’s happening.

Your Case Assessment function is broken in two obvious ways:

Scoring Logic Bug

The front end is displaying all zeros (0/100) even though the “Detailed Case Assessment” text clearly identifies strengths and weaknesses.

This means the scoring function either isn’t being called, or its output isn’t being passed correctly to the UI.

Common culprits:

A missing or mis-wired score object in your route response (e.g., { proofEffectiveness: 0, claimCredibility: 0, ... } being hardcoded or defaulting to 0).

A parsing error where the evaluation logic returns text only, but the score-extraction function never runs.

Formatting / Paragraph Bug

Instead of breaking strengths, weaknesses, counterarguments, and conclusion into sections, your renderer is dumping everything into one giant blob.

This usually happens when line breaks (\n\n) aren’t being respected or when Markdown/HTML is being escaped instead of rendered.

For example, if your LLM returns:

Strengths:
- Conceptual interconnection
- Distinction between language and cognition


…but your code just does .join("") or wraps it in <p> once, you’ll get the wall-of-text effect.

What to Fix

Back end: Make sure your evaluation function outputs both:

scores (numbers for each category, not default 0)

structured analysis (separate fields for strengths, weaknesses, counterarguments, conclusion)

Front end:

Map each numeric score to the UI cards (instead of always showing 0).

Render the assessment with proper line breaks or Markdown (e.g., use .replace(/\n\n/g, "<br><br>") or a Markdown renderer).

Next Step for You

If you want, I can:

Point you to the exact file in your app where this logic probably lives (likely something like server/routes/caseAssessment.ts or analysis.ts).

Give you the precise fix (one or two lines) to stop the 0/100 scores and giant paragraph problem.

Do you want me to dig in and tell you exactly which file and lines to change?
